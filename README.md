# Stack Overflow RSS Feed

This project is a *Proof of Concept (POC)* of the **RxJava** library in the *Android* ecosystem. The implementation is mainly revolving around the *reactive* style of programming; the list of news is fetched from the *StackOverflow* endpoint and then displayed in the view after invoking the update in one of the overridden methods (*onNext*) of the *Observable*. Since the *API call* to obtain the RSS has to be made, which is the asynchronous operation, the **Retrofit** library was incorporated. Additionally, **TikXML** has been used to parse the *XML* response to *Java* models.
